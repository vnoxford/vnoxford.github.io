Founded in **2002**, *Vietnamese Society in Oxford (VOX)* is celebrating more than a decade of connecting Vietnamese lovers in Oxford
with numerous events albeit our small size: Asian Food Festival, Christmas Dinner,

We welcome students and residents from all backgrounds in the Oxfordshire area to our events.

Furthermore, our society possesses an *excellent alumni network* connecting former members
with current members. Our alumni network hosts *various events across the globe* and still works
closely with the current VOX members on various occasions, providing assistance especially in our
charity events.

- President **Tran Quang Anh**,
- Vice-president **Tran Duc**,
- Treasurer **Do Dinh Cao Huan**,
